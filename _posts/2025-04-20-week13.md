# Getting Ready to Present
This week my group was mainly focused on preparing our presentation, which will be on the 23rd. This was a great way to reflect on all of the work we have done so far as well as what the last few weeks have for us.

Finding out that Preswald would be the first project to present, while a bit scary because we will have no reference point, was very exciting as it indicated that we had made some of the best progress of any group so far. I am very proud of the work my group has done, as we have pushed several major features and had a significant amount of code merged, as well as establishing a relationship with the maintainers of the project. Putting the presentation together was a relatively smooth process, as we have done a good job of documenting our progress as we go, but I did have a feature that I planned on presenting, the debug panel, that was still in development, which created a tight deadline. However, it will be ready for the presentation, which is a big accomplishment as it is one of my largest contributions so far. I believe the presentation will go very well on Wednesday and I am excited to see what the other groups have done.
