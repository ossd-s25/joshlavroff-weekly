# Developing a Firefox Browser Extension

## Part 1: The Idea

My team chose to develop a browser extension that tracks the user's time spent on a website. The user can opt in or out of being timed on the tab, and if they opt in it will mark when they opened the tab, when they closed it, and the time spent on it. No one on my team is very familiar with developing extensions, so we wanted to do something relatively simple that would still be useful. With this, you can do things like see how much time a task took you or monitor how much time you spend on something like social media, so it can still have practical uses despite its simplicity.

## Part 2: The Process

Since none of my team has much experience with this sort of project, we are largely working as one unit to figure out each step. The planning was relatively straightforward, a few ideas were thrown around before landing on the timer and because the idea is fairly simple, mapping out how we would get to a finished product was not too much of a challenge. We have yet to finish the extension and get our presentation details worked out, so I will have to update this entry tomorrow with details on the final steps of the process.
